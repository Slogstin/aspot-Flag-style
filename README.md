# Description
This Addon adds Flag icons to *Arookas'* [aspot](https://github.com/arookas/aspot). 

It's made to cover as little of the area around the pinged target as possible, to avoid blocking other important information, especially at bigger distances.

Just load this AFTER aspot and type "*aspot_style flag*" in console!
